## About
KoL is an ugly game full of interesting and intricate interactions. I've been playing since 2006! But I don't think I would be if it weren't for the countless community-created programs and open source mindset. I've really wanted to give back especially since I'm a developer using these shiny new web development tools. Here's hoping this project add a little shine!

This is the public repository for the project, in the future there will be a webpage that you can directly use.

## Usage
Using this is involves a few steps. You'll need to have been using Kolmafia to create session logs and get the script [RunLogSummary](https://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?22963-RunLogSummary). Using the script should generate two txt files: one "raw" and one "run". Upload or drag and drop the raw txt file into the upload area.

It's a work in progress and very early along - it's more for posterity so when I'm gone the community can continue.
